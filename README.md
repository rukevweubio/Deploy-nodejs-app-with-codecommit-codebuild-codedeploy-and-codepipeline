# # Node.js App Deployment with AWS CI/CD Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to containerize a Node.js application, push it to AWS CodeCommit, build and deploy the image using AWS CodeBuild, and finally run it on ECS Fargate with a Load Balancer â€” automating the full CI/CD workflow.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to simulate a real-world DevOps CI/CD pipeline. A simple Node.js application is containerized and deployed using multiple AWS DevOps services. It showcases how teams can automate builds, version control, deployment, and scaling through ECS Fargate and load balancers.

## Problem Statement

In modern software development, deploying updates frequently with minimal downtime is crucial. Manual deployments are error-prone and time-consuming. This project aims to solve that by automating container builds and deployments to AWS ECS using CodePipeline.
